# Recipes

[Recipes](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/recipes/) are a way of defining visualizations in your own packages and code, without having to depend on [Plots](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/). The functionality relies on [RecipesBase](http://juliaplots.org/RecipesBase.jl/stable/), a super lightweight but powerful package which allows users to create advanced plotting logic without Plots.

## 3D Argand Diagrams
An [Argand Diagram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArgandDiagram.html) is a geometric representation of a complex number.

## Instantaneous Spectra
An [Instantaneous Spectrum](https://web.nmsu.edu/~spsandov/ISA/literature.html#openModal1) allows visualization of multiple aspects of the signal model simultaneously, including both magnitude and phase of each signal component. While it may take some time to become comfortable with the 3D visualization, we believe it has significant advantages in terms of interpretability over other time-frequency visualizations.
