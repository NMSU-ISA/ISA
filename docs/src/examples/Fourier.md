# Simple Harmonic Components / Fourier Components

A simple harmonic component (SHC) or Fourier component has a constant instantaneous amplitude $a_0(t)\rightarrow a_0$ and constant instantaneous frequency$\omega_0(t)\rightarrow \omega_0$ and thus corresponds to a canonical triplet with the form
$\mathscr{C}\triangleq\left\{a_0,\omega_0, \phi\vphantom{0^0}\right\}$


# Fourier Series

An AM--FM model that consists of SHCs with frequencies at integer multiples of a fundamental is termed a Fourier Series
$z(t) = \sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k \mathrm{e}^{\,\mathrm{j}(\omega_k t +\phi_k)} $
