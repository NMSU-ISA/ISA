# Instantaneous Spectral Analysis Theory

Instantaneous spectral analysis (ISA) is a general framework for time-frequency analysis consisting of three parts:
1) a parameter set,
2) an instantaneous spectrum (IS), and
3) a complex AM--FM signal model.
More specifically, in this framework:
1) a signal is represented by a set of canonical triplets $\mathscr{S} \triangleq \set{\mathscr{C}_0, \mathscr{C}_1, \cdots,\mathscr{C}_{K-1}}$,  
2) each set has a single-valued mapping to an IS $\mathscr{S}\mapsto\mathcal{S}(t,\omega)$, and
3) each IS has a single-valued mapping to a signal $\mathcal{S}(t,\omega)\mapsto z(t)$.
